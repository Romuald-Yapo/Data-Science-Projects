## Dog Breed Classification

### Description: 
We have developped a Deep Learning model using the pre-trained Keras model in order to classify dog images of differents breeds.  
   Tools/Technologies Used: Tensorflow, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, IPython.display, Google Colab (for the gpu).  
   
### Key Achievements:  
      - Resize and turn images into tensors  
      - Create data batches to speed up the training process  
      - more than 60% of Accuracy with only 100 epochs by using a pre-trained Keras model  
      - Good performance on testing the model of images took on Internet
