Class Activation Map for explainability and understanding of CNN and object detection models  

Description:   After following several courses on Deep Learning models (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Generative Models etc), me and my teammate had to realise a project. The project consisted in the implementation of a well known CNN's explainability method : The Class Activation Map. Our objective was first to understand the research paper related to, implement the method using Python code and libraries and find other approachs that haven't been explored.  

Tools/Technologies Used: Python, Pytorch, Jupyter Notebook, Bibliograpgical Research.   

Key Achievements:
      - Understanding of CNN and the application of the Class Activation Map  
      - Manipulation of recents CNN such that ConvNext Resnet50 and also object detection models (Faster R-CNN)  
      - Improvement of explainability of CNN and object detection models  
      - Evaluation of the model's perfomances (Classification, and Class Activation Map Quality)
