## Efficient Deep Learning Models for Image classification 

### Description: 
During a course on deep learning models, we had to build a solid Deep Learning model for images classification while reducing the size of the model. We during this project understood convolutional neural network architecture and parameter optimization. Our results obtained validate our understanding of this research field. It also gave us the importance of the parameter optimization for the deployment of Deep learning models in real-world cases.

Tools/Technologies Used: Python, Pytorch, VSCode, Linux, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
   
### Key Achievements:  
      - Maintain accuracy of at least 90% on an image classification task (CIFAR10)
      - Implement optimization methods such as quantization, factorization, data augmentation and pruning
      - From scratch training of Resnet18 and VGG16 models
      - 94% accuracy with 80% model size reduction
