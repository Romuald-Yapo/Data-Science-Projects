## Classification of solutions of a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (Well known problem in Operation Research)  
   
   Description: We have developped during an academic project several ML methods in order to classify several solutions and detect which features have a higher impact on the solution.   
   Tools/Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Linear regression, KNN, Random Forests Classifier and regressor, Boosting.  
   
   Key Achievements:
      - Data Manipulation and Understanding of millions of solutions  
      - Features engineering in order to reduce the size of the dataset  
      - Application of severals classification and regression methods  
      - Transform a problem of regression in a problem of classification by using some tresholds  
      - Obtention of some features importance  
      - more than 90% of Accuracy using Random forest
