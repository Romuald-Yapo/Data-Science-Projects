## RNN And LSTM Introduction  

### Description : 
This project describes how useful and important Sequential data Deep Learning Models are. By using an LSTM, the goal is to have very good predictions on signals.  

Tools/Technologies : Python, Pytorch, LSTM, Jupyter Notebook, Linux

### Key Achievments :
    - RNN and LSTM understanding
    - Time series Data forcasting
    - Good performances using LSTM compared to basic Neural Networks
