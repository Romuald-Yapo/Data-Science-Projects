## Bulldozers Prices Predictions  

### Description: 
I have developped a regression Machine Learning model during an Udemy Bootcamp in Data Science that I followed. By fine tuning a Random Forest Regressor, I've reached some good scores on different metrics (MLSE, RMSE, R^2)   

Tools/Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.  
   
### Key Achievements:  
      - Dealing with Time Series Data and missing values (Categorical and numerical)  
      - Tuning Hyper parameters of a Random Forest Regressor  
      - Using differents metrics to evaluate the model (MLSE, RMSE, R^2)  
      - Good performance on test data  (95%)
