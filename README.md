# Data Science Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Science projects portfolio! This repository showcases various projects I have worked on in the field of Data Science. I mainly developped these projects during classes assignments but also by following a Data Scicence Bootcamp of 40 hours on udemy. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and data visualization. 


## Projects

1. Dog Breed Classification

    Description: We have developped a Deep Learning model using the pre-trained Keras model in order to classify dog images of differents breeds.
    Tools/Technologies Used: Tensorflow, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,IPython.display, Google Colab (for the gpu).
    Key Achievements:
      - Resize and turn images into tensors
      - Create data batches to speed up the training process
      - more than 60% of Accuracy with only 100 epochs by using a pre-trained Keras model
      - Good performance on testing the model of images took on Internet
  
2. Bulldozers Prices Predictions
    Description: I have developped a regression Machine Learning model during an Udemy Bootcamp in Data Science that I followed. By fine tuning a Random Forest Regressor, I've reached some good scores on different metrics (MLSE, RMSE, R^2)
    Tools/Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.
    Key Achievements:
      - Dealing with Time Series Data and missing values (Categorical and numerical)
      - Tuning Hyper parameters of a Random Forest Regressor
      - Using differents metrics to evaluate the model (MLSE, RMSE, R^2)
      - Good performance on test data
  


## How to Navigate

Each project is organized in its own directory. 
The jupyter notebook for each project is contained in separate folders.
Detailed documentation is available within each project folder in the README file.
