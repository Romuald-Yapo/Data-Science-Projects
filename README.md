# Data Science Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Science projects portfolio! This repository showcases various projects I have worked on in the field of Data Science. I mainly developped these projects during classes assignments bu also by following a Data Scicence Bootcamp of 40 hours on udemy. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and data visualization. 


## Projects
1. 

    Description: Briefly describe the project and its objectives.
    Tools/Technologies Used: List the main tools and technologies utilized.
    Key Achievements:
        Highlight key insights or outcomes.
        Mention any machine learning models developed.

2. Dog Breed Classification

    Description: We have developped a Deep Learning model using the pre-trained Keras model in order to classify dog images of differents breeds.
    Tools/Technologies Used: Tensorflow, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,IPython.display, Google Colab (for the gpu).
    Key Achievements:
      - Resize and turn images into tensors
      - Create data batches to speed up the training process
      - more than 60% of Accuracy with only 100 epochs by using a pre-trained Keras model
      - Good performance on testing the model of images took on Internet


## How to Navigate

Each project is organized in its own directory. 
The jupyter notebook for each project is contained in separate folders.
Detailed documentation is available within each project folder in the README file.
