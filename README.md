# Data Science Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Science projects portfolio! This repository showcases various projects I have worked on in the field of Data Science. I mainly developped these projects during classes assignments but also by following a Data Scicence Bootcamp of 40 hours on udemy. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and data visualization. 


## Projects

1. Efficient Deep Learning Models for Image Classification
2. Class Activation Map for explainability and understanding of CNN and object detection models
3. RNN and LSTM Introduction
4. Classification of solutions of a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
5.  Dog Breed Classification
6. Bulldozers Prices Predictions
   


## How to Navigate

Each project is organized in its own directory.   
The jupyter notebook and python files for each project are contained in separate folders.  
Project global description is available within each project folder in the `README file`.
