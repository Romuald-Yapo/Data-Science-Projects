# Data Science Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Science projects portfolio! This repository showcases various projects I have worked on in the field of Data Science. I mainly developped these projects during classes assignments bu also by following a Data Scicence Bootcamp of 40 hours on udemy. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and data visualization. 


## Projects
1. 

    Description: Briefly describe the project and its objectives.
    Tools/Technologies Used: List the main tools and technologies utilized.
    Key Achievements:
        Highlight key insights or outcomes.
        Mention any machine learning models developed.

2. Dog Breed Classification

    Description: We have developped a Deep Learning model using the pre-trained Keras model in order to classify dog images of differents breeds.
    Tools/Technologies Used: Tensorflow, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,IPython.display, Google Colab (for the gpu).
    Key Achievements:
      - Resize and turn images into tensors
      - Create data batches to speed up the training process
      - more than 60% of Accuracy with only 100 epochs by using a pre-trained Keras model
      - Good performance on testing the model of images took on Internet
